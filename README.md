# Bot profile append

A simple Python script designed to append the profile bios of your bots with #TwitterBot. Check out our [blog post](https://blog.twitter.com/developer/en_us/topics/community/2020/twitter_developer_policy_update.html) to learn more about our recent updates to our developer policy.

## Getting Started

You will need to update the `secrets.yaml` with the keys and tokens of your bots and your own @handle in the handle field under `admin`. After you update the yaml file, run `python append.py` in your terminal. 

Be sure to add your `secrets.yaml` to your `.gitingore` and check out [our guide on securing keys and tokens](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/authentication/guides/securing-keys-and-tokens).
